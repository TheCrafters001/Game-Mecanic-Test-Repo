# Welcome to this repo!

Hi! I am using this repo for game mechanic concepts I am doing. These may be used in my games. If I don't, I will still keep them public anyways. For anyone who wants to try out, or even use these, feel free to! All I ask is that you credit me.

The game Engine I mainly use is RPG Maker. You will need a copy of RPG Maker in order to view/edit the games, but not to play them. The software tool I have made for this is made in [Visual Studio](http://visualstudio.com), which the community edition is free.

# Folder Organization

So I keep my files in a specific folder structure. It looks something like this:

```
 | (root)
 \
  + Engine
  \
   + Game Idea 1
   |  + Project Files
   |
   + Game Idea 2
   |  + Project Files
   |
   + (etc)
  + Tool Created in VS
```

I will now explain what the heck this means.

## (root)

This is the root of the repo. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Engine

This is the engine I am using. (It will also include their respective GitIgnore files.)

## Game Idea

It won't actually be called Game Idea, but it will be called what the actual game idea is.

### Project Files

It contains the files for the project. What did you expect me to say?

## Tool Created in VS

VS=Visual Studio.

The reason why I include this is because I include it in the main root of the GitHub repo.

# Questions

## Can I contribute my own projects?

Yes! If you want to contribute your own ideas to the repo, create a pull request, follow the folder organization rules, and create a ReadMe file with your project info, and your username :)
